# Password-Saver-Android-Application
**Purpose**: This is an Android Application that disguises itself as a to-do-list while secretly being a password-saver.

**Technologies**: Used *Java* and *XML* to build the application on *Android Studio* and its built-in Android emulator. The data is stored on the *SQLite* database for Android devices.

***Main "Disguise" Page***:

This looks like a normal to-do-list application. But this is a disguise! There is an invisible button on the bottom left corner of the application that lets the user into their own secret password saver.

***Secret Vault***:

This is the secret page that allows used to store username and password. Another step of security is implemented as you need to click on the username / placeholder to see the actual password.

Currently not available on the Play Store.
